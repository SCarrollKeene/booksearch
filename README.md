# Final Project - Book Search


### A Culmination of everything I learned within client-side scripting along with some of my own research diving into API's


### The main page is where all the magic is made! Type in the name of the author or title of a book, click search and behold the results the load on screen!


### The Contact page needs to be linked to php/some type of database in the future, but for example purposes it is made to handle errors with a combination of Regex, try-catch statements, and the "required" tag in html.
